		    We are moving to Africa soon after the wedding.  As a result, we'll be quite limited in what we can bring.  We have registered a few things on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html?ie=UTF8&id=1T7AY13LP9VN&type=wedding"><b>Amazon</b></a> that would be nice to help us get started.
		<br><br>
		   We love biking and what we really would love is a pair of rugged touring bikes that we can take with us on our travels together. We created a <a href="http://www.honeyfund.com/wedding/mattnleigh"><b>bike fund</b></a> for those who'd like to help with this.
	<br><br>
<i>Note: If you do see something that we have listed anywhere other than Amazon, please let us know and we will take it off the registry.</i>
